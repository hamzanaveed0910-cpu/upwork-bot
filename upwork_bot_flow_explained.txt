# Upwork Bot Flow Explained 

This bot helps you find jobs on Upwork automatically. Here’s how everything works, step by step, in easy words:

---

## 1. What does the bot do?
- It logs into Upwork like a real person.
- It grabs job listings using a special search.
- It saves jobs in a database so you don’t see repeats.
- You can filter jobs by keyword (like "python").

---

## 2. How does it look like a real user?
- The bot uses a browser (Chrome) to visit Upwork.
- It grabs special info called "headers" and "tokens" from the browser. These are needed so Upwork thinks you’re a real person, not a bot.
- This is done in the file: `core/auth_manager.py`.

---

## 3. Where are tokens received?
- The bot opens Chrome and listens to all web traffic.
- When Upwork sends a job search request, the bot grabs the headers/tokens from that request.
- If it doesn’t get the main token, it tries a backup.

---

## 4. Which query is targeted?
- The bot uses a special GraphQL query to ask Upwork for jobs.
- This query is in `core/scraper.py`.
- The query can include a keyword to filter jobs (like "python").

---

## 5. Which libraries are used and why?
- `curl_cffi.requests`: Lets the bot send web requests pretending to be Chrome.
- `DrissionPage`: Opens Chrome and listens for web traffic to grab tokens.
- `sqlite3`: Saves jobs in a database so you don’t see the same job twice.
- `asyncio`: Lets the bot do things in the background (like keep checking for jobs).

---

## 6. How does the bot get jobs?
- After getting tokens, the bot sends a request to Upwork using the GraphQL query.
- It gets a list of jobs and saves them in the database.
- It prints new jobs to the screen.
- It keeps checking for new jobs every 30 seconds.

---

## 7. How does keyword filtering work?
- You can give the bot a keyword (like "python") and it will only show jobs with that keyword.
- This is done in the `fetch_jobs` function in `core/scraper.py`.

---

## 8. What happens if something goes wrong?
- If the bot loses its token or can’t get jobs, it tries to refresh the token by opening Chrome again.
- It keeps trying until it works.

---

## 9. Where is everything saved?
- Jobs are saved in a file called `jobs.db` using SQLite.
- The database functions are in `core/db.py`.

---

## 10. What is the test file for?
- `test_keyword_filter.py` lets you test if keyword filtering works.
- It runs the bot, grabs tokens, searches for jobs with a keyword, and prints them.

---

## 11. What do you need to run the bot?
- Chrome installed on your computer.
- Python and the required libraries installed.
- The bot will handle everything else!

---

## 12. Summary
- The bot pretends to be a real user, grabs tokens, searches for jobs, saves them, and keeps checking for new jobs.
- You can filter jobs by keyword.
- If anything breaks, it tries to fix itself.

# What Each Code File Does

Here’s what every main file in your Upwork bot project does, in the easiest words possible:

---

## main.py
- This is the main file that starts the bot.
- It runs everything: gets tokens, fetches jobs, saves jobs, and keeps checking for new jobs.
- If you want to run the bot, you run this file.

---

## core/auth_manager.py
- This file helps the bot pretend to be a real person.
- It opens Chrome, logs into Upwork, and grabs the special info (tokens/headers) needed to search for jobs.
- Without this, the bot can’t get jobs from Upwork.

---

## core/scraper.py
- This file is the “job searcher.”
- It sends a special request (GraphQL query) to Upwork to get job listings.
- It can search for jobs with any keyword you want.
- It returns the job info to the main bot.

---

## core/db.py
- This file saves jobs in a database (jobs.db) so you don’t see the same job twice.
- It can add new jobs, check if a job is already saved, and get all saved jobs.

---

## core/logger.py
- This file helps print messages in a nice way, so you know what the bot is doing.
- It’s not required for the bot to work, but it makes things easier to understand.

---

## test_keyword_filter.py
- This is a test file to check if searching jobs by keyword works.
- It runs the bot, searches for jobs with a keyword (like “python”), and prints the results.

---

## requirements.txt
- This file lists all the Python libraries you need to install for the bot to work.
- You only need to use it when setting up the bot for the first time.

---

## jobs.db
- This is the database file where all found jobs are saved.
- You don’t need to open or edit this file yourself.

---

## bot_profile/ and upwork_bot_profile/
- These folders store browser data so the bot can look like a real user to Upwork.
- They help the bot stay logged in and trusted.
- Don’t delete these unless you want to reset your login.

---

## .env
- This file is for secret settings (if you ever need them). It’s usually empty or optional for this bot.

---

If you ever get lost, just check this file or the comments in the code. Everything is explained in the simplest way possible!
